Dyslexia

Dyslexia is a common learning disability that interferes with reading and
language processing abilities. This is a neurodevelopmental disease that affects
reading and writing skills. It is frequently undiagnosed until later stages of educa-
tion, making early intervention difficult. Problems processing and understanding
what is heard, difficulty seeing similarities and differences in letters and words, dif-
ficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions, late talking are some
symptoms of dyslexic people. Though there is no cure for dyslexia, early detection
and management can be significant. This project intends to create a comprehensive
solution that uses machine learning to detect dyslexia and provides a web applica-
tion to assist people with dyslexia.

EaseLEX

EaseLEX is a comprehensive solution for detecting dyslexia in children and providing specific assistance to help them im-
prove their literacy and cognitive skills.One of the main goals of the project is to create strong machine learning
models that can analyse a variety of linguistic, cognitive, and phonological aspects
and identify dyslexia symptoms. When exposed to gamified language questions
through an online test, people with and without dyslexia can be screened using
machine learning with input data from the interaction measures. The analysis of
linguistic and cognitive data gathered from different evaluations and exams is done
using machine learning techniques. Additionally, this web application offers cus-
tomised assistance to people with dyslexia. Personalised reading activities, interac-
tive phonics courses, and speech recognition tools are among the features that help
with language and reading comprehension. Text-to-speech and speech-to-text func-
tionality helps in improving the user’s capacity to associate words with the sounds
that they correlate with.

Objectives

• The project aims to develop an innovative dyslexia detection and assistance
monitoring system employing gamification strategies. Objectives include
crafting an engaging dyslexia detection platform through gamified assess-
ments, fostering an inclusive learning environment.

• The system will feature learning exercises and interventions to address spe-
cific dyslexia-related challenges.

• The system provides assistance to dyslexic individuals by means of audio
books, text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.
